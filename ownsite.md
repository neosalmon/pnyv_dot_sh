Details Matter 002: My own blog

-> I wrote an article on how Svbtle had some UI / UX flaws, and while browsing through my own blog I found some flaws glaring back at me as well. I plan on constantly updating this article, as you never know what part of my own blog I miss due to not paying enough attention to the details here.

Redundancy one- the nav.

One major flaw my blog (or this theme?) has is- whenever the header navigation menu is activated, an automatic entry- “Posts” gets added to the menu. Now, “Home” and “Posts” serve basically the same purpose. I’m trying to figure out a way to close this redundancy down, though!
