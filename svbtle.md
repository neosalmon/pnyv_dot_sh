Details Matter- UX Microcopy for Svbtle

Details Matter 001: Svtble

-> Before settling on a configuration utilizing Hugo and Netlify in order to serve this site up to you readers, I admittedly hopped around on my blog-wagon, jumping from one platform to the other- be it WordPress, Ghost, Jekyll, Grav, Postach.io or even the likes of Squarespace, Wix and Webflow.

During my “tours,” I stumbled across a rather eye-catching platform- (you guessed it) Svbtle. The reason I choose to write this first post dedicated to Svbtle’s inconsistencies in the UI / UX decisions is because had Svbtle accepted Debit Cards, you would’ve been looking at a Svbtle blog. I genuinely liked the platform’s generated blogs. The Homepage of the platform’s descriptive itself? Not so much.

The Homepage

The first thing I noticed as soon as I landed on Svbtle.com is the official “Svbtle icon / logo.” Text wrapped inside a circle- looks good, but inconsistent with the rest of the site (or the network- more on this later. soon.)

The Icon

You see, all of Svbtle’s blogs have an icon up-top which is essentially a picture enclosed in a thick, solid border of the accent color of the blog. And it’s the same for all blogs- even Svbtle’s blog itself.

Had the homepage featured a similar image wrapped inside a thick, solid, circular border instead of text wrapped inside a circle, and had the “image” here been an actual icon for Svbtle, this post would’ve been a section short.

Some would argue that the icon is such in order to make it look consistent with the “Sign Up” button underneath- however, as it is now, it looks good enough (in relation to the homepage only, not the entire network)- and should we make the changes stated above, it’ll still look good enough in relation to the homepage but better in relation to the entire network.

Next, I noticed the short description.

The “promo-” short description.

SVBTLE is a writing and reading network designed from the ground up to work the same way your brain does. It helps you curate ideas and includes everything you need to develop and publish your thoughts to the world
The “writing” part is visible, sure- the monetization thrives around it. However, the “reading network” part isn’t visible. At all. The fact that a lot of these blogs have the same theme and carry the “SVBTLE” credits doesn’t make the entire platform a reading network.

A “Discover” tab with posts laid out in a descending order of Kudos recieved or a “Browse” tab with the same layout of posts, clubbed according to the respective categories would’ve made much more sense.

The About page

As far as the content goes, almost everything here is a description of the project in the creator’s words. However, the one thing that could be tweaked for the better is the “About” text in the upper left-hand corner of the page.The text makes it look as if the user will be going back to the About page.

The text should read “Home” instead.

The Help page

Aside from the fact that the “Help” page has “Help” displayed in the upper left-hand corner as well, there isn’t much here as well. Aside from the fact that the last three links under the main content of the page are redundant as they appear inside the footer as well.

As a user, or as a “visitor” of the site, all of my attention was towards the three links inside the content of the page. In cases like these, removal of the footer wouldn’t hurt- at all. It’ll only help reduce redundancy, which is positive.

The blogs

This is the part about Svbtle that I like the most. Clean, minimal blogs that throw content at the user for total consumption. Everything from the way images are displayed on featured blocks to the way blockquotes are designed is appealing.

The credits

However, (you probably saw the “however” coming this time around, didn’t you?) I really think individual blogs shouldn’t have the universal “SVBTLE” footer. Instead, and building on the minimal ethos of the entire “network,” the text from the sidebar, which reads:

X is writing on the SVBTLE network.
should just be transported to the footer. In addition, in my opinion, the “about svbtle” and “sign up” links from the sidebar should be transported to the footer as well.

In fact, “sign up” shouldn’t even be there. A lot of users might think they could sign up for the actual blog on the network.

The nav

A little redundancy here as well. The icon up-top (upper left-hand corner) has the same function as the icon up-top, centre- the blog icon. Removing the former seems optimal, here.

Also, the hamburger menu in the top-right corner is fixed, and the user has to scroll all the way to the top of the blog from the bottom-post post in order to access the sidebar-menu. Making the hamburger menu icon scrollable will save the user more time and make the menu more accessible.

##Concluding

I honestly didn’t think I could make it this far- 835 words and spanned across four sections. If honestly hope you’ve skimmed this through. However, if you’ve actually read the entire thing, I’m guessing you liked it- or are extremely critical of it. In any case, for either appreciating my publishing the post or appreciated the courage I had to publish something like this and call it a post, hit the Kudos button- oh wait.

PS- I know the quality of images isn’t optimal. I’m working on better image support as you read this sentence.
